* Build
** css:
For $sites assume the name of the python ~Site~ object or `$CONFIG_NAME` in nim.
- If new icons have to be added, a use the `index.test.html` and the vite server to access the unocss dashboard, and copy the css from the dashboard into `src/css/icons.scss`.
- run the nim server `nim r src/nim/server.nim` on port `:5050`
- `scripts/copy.sh -css $sites` (ensure that `npm run build` is working correctly by checking files in `dist/*.css` to be fresh.)
- scripts/docker.sh -c $sites
* Deploy
- Ensure /mnt is a mounted storage on remove server
- create /mnt/hosts directory
- copy `data` directory to /mnt/hosts/data
- ensure docker is running
- make sure the start script includes dns option for configuring timeout (important for proxies)
- run docker image using script in `scripts/start.sh`
* NIM compilation
- `panics:on` can't be enabled, the codebase does large use of indexdefects
